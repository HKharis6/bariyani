<h1>Instructions: </h1>
                      <ul> 
                        <p style="background-color: antiquewhite;">In a large mixing bowl, combine the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt.
                            Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and mix well to coat the chicken evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight for best results.
                            Cook the Rice:
                            
                            In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil.
                            Add the soaked and drained rice along with green cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, bay leaf, and salt.
                            Cook the rice until it's about 70-80% cooked. The grains should still have a slight bite to them.
                            Drain the rice and set it aside.
                            Fry the Onions:
                            
                            Heat ghee or cooking oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan.
                            Add the sliced onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove half of the fried onions for garnish and set them aside.
                            Layer the Biryani:
                            
                            In the same pan with the remaining fried onions, add the marinated chicken pieces along with any marinade that's left.
                            Cook the chicken on medium-high heat until it's partially cooked and the oil starts to separate from the marinade.
                            Add chopped tomatoes and green chilies. Cook until the tomatoes soften.
                            Assemble and Cook:
                            
                            Layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken mixture.
                            Sprinkle fresh mint and coriander leaves over the rice.
                            Drizzle the saffron milk over the top (if using).
                            Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with aluminum foil to trap the steam.
                            Dum Cooking:
                            
                            Reduce the heat to low and let the biryani cook on "dum" (slow steam cooking) for about 20-25 minutes.
                            Check for doneness by testing a piece of chicken and rice. They should be fully cooked and tender.
                            Serve:
                            
                            Gently fluff the biryani with a fork and garnish with the reserved fried onions.
                            Serve hot with raita (yogurt sauce) or a side salad.
                            Enjoy your delicious homemade chicken biryani! </p>
